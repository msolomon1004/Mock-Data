### 1.) What Licensing Agreement did you choose and why?

I chose the Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal License agreement because my data is mock data. Thus, I feel no need to keep my copyrights and will allow anyone who needs random data to use it. I do not want to give permission to anyone to use it. I also do no claim any liability and provide no warranty on the merit of this data.

### 2.) What are data archiving options are recommended by the Montana State University Library?

Dryad, Zenodo, ICPSR.

### 3.) How would using GitHub help make your data/code align with FAIR Protocols?

GitHub would allow me to make my data Findable, Acessible, Interoperable, and Reuseable not only for myself but for my colleagues by saving it in a safe repository but by providing metadata that allows it to be found and easily understandable. It will motivate me to make my data legible and detailed so that all of my hard work will not be lost and potentially reserach will not have to be duplicated in the future.

### 4.) What are the advantages of making your data/code more widely accessible?

Research that has already been done will not be repeated. 
Current research can be expedited if data has already been conducted and is accessible.
Data will never be lost.

### 5.) What are the disadvantages of making your data/code more widely accessible?

Loss of integretity. For example, data can be misused, misinterpreted, and miscontrued when used by second or third parties if not put underneath the appropriate liscencse agreement. In light of this, you probably don't want to publish your data if it is not completely ready to go and checked for quality assurance.

### 6.) What data/code from your grad project would you envision publishing on GitHub?

I envision publishing my data and code for delineating habitat conditions surrounding stable lek locations of Lesser Prairie-Chickens. It would be useful for future researchers in determining/delineating acceptable habitat for Lesser Prairie-Chicken persistence.

### 7.) What data/code would you not publish? Why?

From my graduate project I am not sure that I have any data that I would not publish. However, if my data is supposed to be completely confidential I do not think I would publish. I also may be hesitant to publish data that I am not fully confident in or I am not sure what it contains--none the less it could be useful to someone elses research.
